## v0.2.0

- Additional SQL tests with `tempfile`
- Additional context to database read and write errors
- Support for a new silent payments feature-flag:
  - Receive block filters directly

- Only request headers for `inv` the node does not have
- Max v2 handshake buffer size increased
- Changes to `BlockQueue` to not spam peers with requests
- Internal module renames

## v0.1.0

## Added

- `NodeBuilder` offers configuration options to build a compact block filters `Node` and `Client`
- `Client` is further split into `ClientSender` and `Receiver<NodeMessage>`
- `ClientSender` may: add scripts, broadcast transactions, rescan block filters, stop the node
- `Node` may run and send `NodeMessage`, `Warning` while running
- Connections to peers are encrypted if `ServiceFlags::P2P_V2` is signaled
- Connections are terminated if peers do not respond within a custom `Duration`
- Peers are selected at random with a target preference of 50% new and 50% tried
- Connections are terminated after long duration times to find new reliable peers
- Blocks are considered "stale" if there has not been a new inv message after 30 minutes. Block headers are requested again to ensure no inv were missed.
- Transactions are broadcast according to a configurable policy, either to all connections for higher reliability, or to a random peer for better privacy
- Default implementers of `PeerStore` and `HeaderStore` are `SqlitePeerDb` and `SqliteHeaderDb`
